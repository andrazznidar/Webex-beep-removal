# Webex-beep-removal
Mein erster und bester Versuch of creating a filter to filter annoying beeping whenever someone joins or leaves a Cisco Webex meeting on-the-fly!

## Usage
1. Join a meeting from your browser (tested in Firefox and Chrome)
2. Open _DevTools_ (`F12` on your keyboard)
3. Switch to the _Console_ tab of DevTools
4. Copy code from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zznidar/Webex-beep-removal/main/code.js
5. Paste it into the Console, apply with `Enter`
6. Migrainelessly enjoy the meeting with beeps greatly reduced!
